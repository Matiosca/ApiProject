# ApiProject
Project to display best rated games by category. Made using RAWG APIs https://matiosca.github.io/ApiProject/

Built so it never reloads the browser, it only starts a new API call with different parameters.

I'm looking for a way to improve javascript code [starting line :143 ending :252] because the only way to have the App work as intended
had me repeat almost identical code over and over.
^code is commented to give a better insight to my decisions
